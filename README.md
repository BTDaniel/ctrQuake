# ctrQuake
ctrQuake is a free, unofficial port of Quake for the Nintendo 3DS. It is fully playable, but still in early stages.
## Installation
- Follow the guide for running homebrew at [http://smealum.github.io/3ds/](http://smealum.github.io/3ds/)
- Place `ctrQuake.3dsx` and `ctrQuake.smdh` on your SD card under the directory **/3ds/ctrQuake**
- Place `id1` folder and any additional files into the same directory
- Launch ctrQuake from the Homebrew Launcher

## Usage
You must first bind the keys on the options screen before playing

To use mods: place mod folder in the same directory as ctrQuake.3dsx and create a shortcut with the folder name as argument. See tf.xml as example
