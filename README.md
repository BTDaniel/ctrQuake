# ctrQuake
ctrQuake is a free, unoficial port of Quake for the Nintendo 3DS. It is fully playable, but still in early stages.
## Installation

## Usage
You must first bind the keys on the options screen before playing

To use mods: place mod folder in the same directory as ctrQuake.3dsx and create a shortcut with the folder name as argument. See tf.xml as example
